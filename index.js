// simple const will suffice to pass test
// define num1 and num2 as the specific numbers to equate to 62 when multiplied
// then construct multiply using order of operations (*) operator
const num1 = 31
const num2 = 2

// interesting to note; math.floor and math.round work to pass the lab
// yet math.cecil does not pass even though it would round up, why? 
const random = Math.round(Math.random() * 10) + 1;

// const numbers first that give out the remainder as 4
// then const mod and include the operation

// include math.max in the const and add random numbers of your choosing within parentheses
